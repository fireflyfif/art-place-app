## App Description
Art Place is an app for art lovers, artists or people who just enjoy seeing a piece of artwork. Browse through famous artworks and see their location and other details. Find out who are their artists and see more details about them too.

- The App fetches data from the Artsy API and displays an endless scroll with Artworks. 
- The App allows saving favorite items into a local database, using the [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room). 
- The App displays a reasonable subset of the data, thanks to the [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) that requests a small portion of data at a time and provides pagination. That way the app consumes less network bandwidth and fewer system resources.

## Configurations
In order to run this app please add your own token from the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/). 
Place your TOKEN to `build.gradle` 
```gradle
def apiToken = project.hasProperty('token') ? apiToken : (System.getenv('TOKEN') ?: "\"YOUR_TOKEN\"")
```
